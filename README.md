# SoilSense: Smart Crop Recommendation System

Welcome to the **SoilSense: Smart Crop Recommendation System** repository! This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques for soil classification and provides crop recommendations based on the soil type and weather conditions. It aims to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions to improve agricultural productivity by offering tailored suggestions for optimal crop selection.

## Introduction

The **SoilSense** system uses a deep learning-based model to classify soil types from images, such as sandy, loamy, or clayey soils. Based on the identified soil type, it provides recommendations for suitable crops, taking into account various environmental factors like temperature and humidity. The system integrates real-time weather data to refine crop suggestions and make them more accurate.

The project aims to make smart agricultural decisions accessible to farmers, especially in regions with limited resources, by providing timely, data-backed guidance. The system has a simple user interface for uploading soil images and viewing the crop recommendations along with weather information.

## Objectives

1. **Soil Type Classification**:
   - Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify soil images into categories such as sandy, loamy, clayey, etc.
   
2. **Crop Recommendation Logic**:
   - Implement rule-based logic that recommends suitable crops based on the classified soil type and environmental conditions.
   
3. **Weather Data Integration**:
   - Fetch real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) via APIs to enhance the accuracy of crop recommendations.
   
4. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Build a simple, intuitive web interface for users to upload soil images and view crop recommendations.
   
5. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Implement multi-language support to cater to users in different regions and languages.

6. **Live Camera Integration**:
   - Allow users to capture live images of soil using their camera and upload them for classification and recommendations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Soil Type Classification**: Automatically classifies soil types from images using a trained deep learning model.
- **Crop Recommendations**: Provides a list of recommended crops based on the classified soil type.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Fetches current weather information (temperature, humidity, etc.) for the user's location to enhance crop suggestions.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: A web-based interface to easily upload soil images and view the recommendations.
- **Live Camera Support**: Users can take live pictures of soil and get recommendations instantly.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The system supports multiple languages to cater to users from different regions.

## Usage

1. **Soil Type Classification**: Upload a soil image via the web interface. The system classifies the soil type and displays the result.
2. **Crop Recommendations**: Based on the soil type, the system fetches crop recommendations, considering the weather data for the userâ€™s location.
3. **Weather Data**: Users can enter their city or location to receive up-to-date weather information that impacts crop growth.
4. **Live Camera Integration**: Use your mobile or web camera to capture soil images directly for classification and recommendations.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the **SoilSense** system on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SoilSense.git
cd SoilSense
Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
